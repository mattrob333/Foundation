## ðŸ”§ Troubleshooting Common Issues

### "I Don't Know What Data to Add"

**Solution Framework:**
1. Start with the company website
2. Check their latest news/blog
3. Look at job postings (reveals pain points)
4. Read customer reviews
5. Check competitor websites

**Minimum Viable Foundation:**
- Company overview (from website)
- 3 competitors (from Google)
- Industry trends (from news)
- Basic tech stack (from job posts)

### "The Agents Sound Generic"

**Diagnosis Prompts:**
```
@ATLAS Do you have access to the company overview file?
@ATLAS What industry is this company in?
@ATLAS What are their main products?
```

**Fixes:**
1. Check file has correct YAML header
2. Ensure agent_scope includes agent name
3. Add more specific industry context
4. Include actual company data, not just templates

### "Client Wants Different Agents"

**Customization Examples:**

**For Retail Client:**
- ATLAS â†’ Market & Consumer Trends
- NAVIGATOR â†’ Store Operations & Inventory
- MAESTRO â†’ E-commerce & POS Systems
- CATALYST â†’ Customer Experience

**For Healthcare Client:**
- ATLAS â†’ Healthcare Policy & Competition
- NAVIGATOR â†’ Patient Flow & Clinical Operations
- MAESTRO â†’ EMR & Medical Systems
- CATALYST â†’ Staff Training & Compliance

**Update agent prompts to reflect focus:**
```markdown
# In ATLAS.md for healthcare:
You are ATLAS, the Strategic Intelligence Officer for [CLIENT_NAME], 
specializing in healthcare market dynamics, regulatory changes, 
and competitive positioning in the medical sector.
```

### "How Do I Know It's Working?"

**Foundation Health Check:**

Level 1 - Basic Function:
```
@ATLAS What does this company do?
@NAVIGATOR What are their main operations?
@MAESTRO What technology do they use?
@CATALYST What's their reputation?
```

Level 2 - Integrated Intelligence:
```
@ATLAS @NAVIGATOR What's our biggest opportunity?
@MAESTRO @CATALYST How do we implement it?
```

Level 3 - Strategic Value:
```
@ATLAS If we had $1M to invest, where should it go?
@NAVIGATOR How would we measure success?
@MAESTRO What would we need to build?

## ðŸ’¡ Training Tips from the Field

1. **Start with Your Own Company**
   - Less pressure
   - You know what's right/wrong
   - Good for demos later

2. **Use Real Companies for Practice**
   - Public companies have more data
   - B2B companies are easier than B2C
   - Avoid stealth mode startups

3. **Time Yourself**
   - First Foundation: 6-8 hours
   - Second: 4-5 hours
   - Third: 2-3 hours
   - Goal: 2 hours for basic setup

4. **Common Beginner Mistakes**
   - Too much data (information overload)
   - Too generic (not company-specific)
   - Wrong agent boundaries (mixing domains)
   - Forgetting to test responses

5. **Build a Swipe File**
   - Save good prompts that worked
   - Keep templates for common industries
   - Document successful customizations
   - Share wins with team

Remember: Every Foundation gets easier. The goal is not perfection but a working system that delivers value. Your fourth Foundation will be 10x better than your first!
